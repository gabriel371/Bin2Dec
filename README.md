# Bin2Dec

A simple Flutter project based on [florinpop17](https://github.com/florinpop17/)'s idea for beginners that consists in a application that converts from binary digits to decimals.

I decided to differ a bit from the original roadmap so instead of letting the user enter 0 or 1 from the device's keyboard on a input field, here the application presents 8 buttons in line containing and displaying a switcheable binary digit each. Below this line we have the result in decimals, and it automatically updates as the binary sequence changes.

The user can also copy to clipboard the decimal result by long pressing over it.
